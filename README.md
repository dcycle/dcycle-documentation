* The text you are currently reading exists in markdown format on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcycle/dcycle-documentation/blob/main/README.md)
* An [index.html file exists at the same level as the README file](https://github.com/dcycle/dcycle-documentation/blob/master/index.html)
* GitHub Pages is enabled for this repo at `settings:pages`.
* [documentation.dcycle.com](https://documentation.dcycle.com) has a CNAME entry `dcycle.github.io.` (including the trailing dot).
* A [CNAME](https://github.com/dcycle/dcycle-documentation/blob/master/CNAME) file the repo contains `documentation.dcycle.com`.
